We are going to see how to use YOLO v3, v4 and v5.    

#1. Dataset    
First of all, you need labeling your custom images.    
If you have your familiar tool, do that thang.    
Or I recommend you labelbox <https://labelbox.com/>.    
You can do labeling on website without installation any labeling tool or github labeling repository.    

1. Make your new project and fill out some information, then attach your dataset.    

2. In attach a dataset, click 'upload new dataset' and really upload it.    

3. In customize your label editor - Select existing - Editor,    
click the tab 'Configure' then you could add your object!    
Click the 'Add object', then enter class name.    
Don't forget to change the option to Bounding box, if you want to do the object detection.    
Click the 'Confirm' and 'Complete setup'.    
Then you could see the tab 'Start labeling', also you could invite your friend.
